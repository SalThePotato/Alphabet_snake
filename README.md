# Alphabet_snake

I am a beginner and still learning about C++.
This was a project I did to learn some more. 
Not good code. Naming and everything is pretty hard
to read. 

When I talk about pos or position in this project. I am
talking about a number from 1-100 that represents a position on the board. 

The project is hard to read and I forgot to put comments but I hope the simplicity of the code
will be good enough.
